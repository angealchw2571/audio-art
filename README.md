<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Converting audio to something visually stimulating. In the early 2000s, windows media player was well known for their audio visualization when using their application, with bright and vivid colourful shapes that transform according to the audio played. 

I hope to create an application where it will convert an audio sample to pixelated images that corresponds to the context of the audio. Eventually it may be hosted on a server and website where users can upload a clipped audio file, and generate a pixelated art image.
